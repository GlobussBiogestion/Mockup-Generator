# Mockup-Generator
API that is used to generate mockups with the superimposition of two images, one in the background and another that represents the product to be tested. In this moment it is used to test paintings on walls and prints on mugs (using the option to activate 3D) and on pencils.

# How to perform
To use it simply click on this link: https://globuss.pythonanywhere.com/

Select the two images that will be part of the mockup and activate the 3D option if a cylindrical curvature is required for a mug.

Click on the "generate mockup" button, wait a few seconds and when the browser stops loading, click on "see result". In the new pop-up window you will have controllers to re-scale and rotate the overlaid image, you can also change the position with a drag and drop system.
